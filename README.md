## Description

 - A football analysis and prediction app created using ReactJS and Flask.
 - The application uses ML and AI to predict predict team and player statistics and attributes.

### Server

 - The server for the app is created using flask.
 - Data scraping is performed on the server, after which we use our own API's to create/fetch JSON data sets.
 - Uding these data sets we have created the machine learning models to predict player similarity, market value, expected goals etc using python.
 - We have deployed the developed models on the server. 

### Client
